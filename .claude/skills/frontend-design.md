# frontend-design

## Overview
Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## Design Thinking Approach

Before coding, commit to a **BOLD aesthetic direction**:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone**: Pick a clear direction:
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian
3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL:** Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Intentionality matters more than intensity.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose **beautiful, unique, and interesting** fonts
- Avoid generic fonts (Arial, Inter)
- Use **unexpected, characterful font choices**
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a **cohesive aesthetic**
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid palettes

### Motion
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on **high-impact moments**: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth (not just solid colors)
- Contextual effects and textures matching the aesthetic
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

## What to AVOID

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character

## Implementation Principles

- **Production-grade and functional** code
- **Visually striking and memorable** design
- **Cohesive** with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- **Meticulously refined** in every detail
- Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision
