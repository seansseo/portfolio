    <!-- Problem -->

        <h2 class="project-section__title reveal">The Problem</h2>
        <div class="project-section__text reveal">
          <p>
            AI tools are great at generating text, but terrible at getting technical details right. Ask an LLM about a specific API endpoint or config flag and you'll often get a confident answer that's completely wrong. The issue isn't the model. It's the lack of grounded context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tools like NotebookLM help, but they require you to manually collect and feed in documentation URLs. For large sites with hundreds of pages nested across sitemaps, that process alone can take hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built a simple URL extractor to solve this. It worked, but it only solved half the problem. I still had to leave the tool, paste URLs into a separate AI interface, and hope the context carried over. The extraction and the intelligence needed to live in the same place.

          <p>
            DocWeb handles the entire pipeline. Point it at any website and it discovers sitemaps, crawls pages, and builds a visual knowledge graph of the site's structure. Clusters of related content emerge automatically, color-coded and interactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then ask questions. DocWeb's AI chatbot (powered by Gemini API) retrieves relevant pages from the graph and generates answers grounded in the actual documentation, with citations linking back to the source. Every answer is traceable.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works on any public website, not just documentation. Marketing sites, knowledge bases, support portals. If it has a sitemap, DocWeb can map it.

            DocWeb started as a 150-line Google Apps Script that extracted URLs from XML sitemaps. That script became a web app. The web app became a platform. Each iteration added a new layer: first the data extraction, then the visualization, then the AI chat grounded in real documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Documentation Extractor is still available as a standalone tool for simple URL extraction. DocWeb is the full platform for teams and individuals who need deeper context from their documentation.
