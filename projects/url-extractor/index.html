  <!-- Problem -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="project-section__title reveal">The Problem</h2>
      <div class="project-section__text reveal">
        <p>
          LLMs hallucinate often, especially when asked for information on complex and frequently updated technical
          documentation. Ask
          about a specific API parameter, CLI flag, or configuration schema and there's a good chance it'll confidently
          give you something that doesn't exist. The training data is often outdated or generic — and for technical
          documentation, "close enough" isn't good enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fix is grounding the model with official, up-to-date documentation so it has the real source of truth.
          Tools like NotebookLM make this easy — if you have the URLs. But most documentation sites have hundreds or
          thousands of pages spread across nested sitemaps. Manually hunting for the right URLs is tedious and
          incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
          I kept running into this friction every time I wanted to create an AI-powered reference for a new technology.
          The Documentation Extractor was built to eliminate it.

  <!-- Solution -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="project-section__title reveal">The Solution</h2>
      <div class="project-section__text reveal">
        <p>
          Enter a domain and the Documentation Extractor discovers its sitemaps — checking <code>robots.txt</code> for
          directives and falling back to common paths. It recursively parses every sitemap index, fetches URLs in
          batches with exponential-backoff retry, and deduplicates the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          A keyword filtering UI lets you narrow results in real time — include or exclude URL paths with a tag-bubble
          interface — then copy the filtered list to your clipboard with one click. Paste directly into NotebookLM and
          you've got an expert guide grounded in official sources, built in seconds instead of hours.

  <!-- Limitations -->

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="project-section__title reveal">Limitations</h2>
      <div class="project-section__text reveal">
        <p>
          The Documentation Extractor was built as a lightweight prototype, and it has several limiting constraints.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Requires a well-structured sitemap.</strong> The tool relies on a valid <code>robots.txt</code>
            pointing to XML sitemaps, or a <code>/sitemap.xml</code> at the root. Sites without this setup return no
            results.</li>
          <li><strong>Large sitemaps time out.</strong> Google Apps Script has a 6-minute execution limit. Sites with
            very large sitemaps (e.g., <code>cloud.google.com</code> with 100,000+ URLs) will exceed this, causing the
            app to fail. It works best on small-to-medium documentation sites.</li>
          <li><strong>No progress feedback.</strong> Because <code>google.script.run</code> is a single async call,
            there's no way to stream progress back to the UI. The spinner shows until processing either completes or
            times out.</li>
          <li><strong>Apps Script quota limits.</strong> <code>UrlFetchApp</code> is subject to daily quota limits.
            Heavy use may trigger rate limiting even with exponential backoff.</li>
          <li><strong>NotebookLM source limits.</strong> NotebookLM caps sources at 50 or 300 depending on your Google
            account tier. The keyword filtering helps you stay within that limit, but it significantly constrains the
            depth and coverage of the guides you can build from large documentation sites.</li>
          <li><strong>Native documentation chatbots.</strong> Many large tech companies now embed chatbot assistants
            directly into their documentation sites, which can be more reliable for single-site Q&A.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          The Documentation Extractor is the "v0" prototype that proved out a core workflow: <strong>automated sitemap
            discovery and URL extraction</strong>. That workflow became the starting point for <a
            href="../docweb/">DocWeb</a>, a more fully featured sitemap extraction and chatbot platform that addresses
          many of these limitations.
